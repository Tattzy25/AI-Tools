# UX Guidelines

- Use shadcn components exclusively; Buttons for primary actions, Cards for sections
- Provide contextual tooltips for non-obvious controls
- Progressive disclosure: show results/advanced options only after core actions
- Consistent feedback: success/error via toast with concise titles/descriptions
- Responsive navigation: `NavigationMenu` desktop, toggled mobile menu
